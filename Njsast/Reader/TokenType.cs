// The assignment of fine-grained, information-carrying type objects
// allows the tokenizer to store the information it has about a
// token in a way that is very cheap for the parser to look up.

// The `beforeExpr` property is used to disambiguate between regular
// expressions and divisions. It is set on all token types that can
// be followed by an expression (thus, a slash after them would be a
// regular expression).
//
// The `startsExpr` property is used to check if the token ends a
// `yield` expression. It is set on all token types that either can
// directly start an expression (like a quotation mark) or can
// continue an expression (like the body of a string).
//
// `isLoop` marks a keyword as starting a loop, which is important
// to know when parsing a label, in order to allow or disallow
// continue jumps to that label.
